# Autonomous Work Mesh (AWM)

**Autonomous Work Mesh (AWM)** is a libre, modular framework for designing, coordinating, and evolving autonomous work systems composed of agents, tasks, protocols, and execution contexts.

AWM is intended for:
- Autonomous agents (human, AI, hybrid)
- Cooperative and ethical automation
- Task orchestration without centralized control
- Reproducible, inspectable workflows
- Non-extractive, non-predatory software ecosystems

This project is released into the **public domain** under the Unlicense.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Agents** — entities that perform work (human, AI, system)
- **Tasks** — atomic units of work
- **Protocols** — rules governing task execution
- **Meshes** — decentralized coordination structures
- **Workstreams** — chained task flows with intent

AWM prioritizes:
- Transparency
- Modularity
- Replaceability
- Autonomy-first design
