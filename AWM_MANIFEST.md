# Autonomous Work Mesh — Manifest

Autonomous Work Mesh (AWM) exists to explore and enable:

- Decentralized work coordination
- Agent autonomy over task execution
- Ethical, non-extractive automation
- Cooperative and anti-hierarchical system design

AWM is not a product.
It is not a platform.
It is not a SaaS.

It is a **pattern language** for organizing work.

## Core Principles

1. **Autonomy First**
   Agents choose how and when work is performed.

2. **Replaceability**
   No agent, task, or protocol is sacred.

3. **Inspectability**
   All processes should be understandable.

4. **Forkability**
   Divergence is a feature, not a failure.

5. **Anti-Capture**
   No dependency on centralized ownership.

## What AWM Is Not

- A productivity surveillance tool
- A labor extraction engine
- A centralized AI control plane
- A proprietary workflow system

---

## Intended Use Cases

- Cooperative tech collectives
- Ethical AI experimentation
- Mutual-aid coordination
- Research & education
- Autonomous operations design

---

## Future Directions

AWM may eventually include:
- Reference schemas
- Execution engines
- Agent runtimes
- Cooperative governance templates

All optional. All forkable.

---

## Closing

AWM exists so work can be:
- Humane
- Voluntary
- Transparent
- Shared

Build responsibly.
